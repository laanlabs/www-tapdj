The contest is applicable to any resident of a country with an active iTunes Apple App Store.

If we are not able to ship your prize at a reasonable price, we will provide you with an iTunes Gift card of equivalent value.

The contest runs from Saturday February 5th to Wednesday 9th, 2011 New York City, New York, USA Time (GMT -5)

Any entries on February 4th will be entered into the day of February 5th.

So depending on your country of residence, you may be entering for a different day than your local time.

A winner will be chosen at random at the end of each day from our verified twitter and facebook entries.

If we determine a winner has used an unfair method of entry besides our website, we will pick another winner.

We will feature winners on our homepage unless they request to not be featured.
